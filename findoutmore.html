        Archaeology is the study of the ancient and recent human past through
        material remains. Archaeologists might study the million-year-old
        fossils of our earliest human ancestors in Africa. Or they might study
        20th-century buildings in present-day New York City. Archaeology
        analyzes the physical remains of the past in pursuit of a broad and
        comprehensive understanding of human culture

      <h4 class="mb-3">What do archeologist do?</h4>
      <p>
        Archaeologists use scientific sampling techniques to guide them as to
        where they need to dig on the site. They observe, record, categorize,
        and interpret what they find, then share their findings with other
        scientists and the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing and building on knowledge from the humanities and social,
        physical, and biological sciences, archaeologists examine the ways of
        prehistoric societies in various parts of the world. They also examine
        the customs, values, and social patterns of different cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many archaeologists use sophisticated tools and technologies in their
        work. Although tasks vary by specialty, materials often include
        excavating tools, laboratory equipment, statistical and database
        software, and geographic information systems (GIS). An archaeologist
        will typically do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Plan research projects to answer questions and test hypotheses about
          human activity through environmental data left behind
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop data collection methods tailored to a particular specialty,
          project, or culture
        </li>
        <li>
          Collect information from observations, interviews, and documents
        </li>
        <li>Record and manage records of observations taken in the field</li>
        <li>
          Analyze data, laboratory samples, and other sources to uncover
          patterns about human life, culture, and origins
        </li>
        <li>Write reports and give presentations on research findings</li>
        <li>
          Advise organizations on the cultural impact of proposed plans,
          policies, and programs
        </li>
      </ul>
